## Overview
This is a simple yet powerful password generator. It allows you to generate a random password with a length of your choice. The generated password includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, ensuring a high level of security.

## Functionality
The password generator has two main functions:

1. **generate()**: This function generates a random password. The length of the password is determined by the value entered by the user. The password is composed of a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

2. **copyToClipboard()**: This function copies the generated password to the clipboard. A tick mark is displayed for 3 seconds to indicate that the password has been successfully copied.

## Usage
To generate a password, simply enter the desired length and click the 'Generate' button. Once the password is generated, it can be copied to the clipboard by clicking the 'Copy' button.

## Future Enhancements
Stay tuned for future updates where we plan to add more features to enhance the functionality and user experience of the password generator.
